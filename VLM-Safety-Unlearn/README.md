This is the official code repository for the paper [Safety Mirage: How Spurious Correlations Undermine VLM Safety Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11832).


<!-- ## Release 

- [4/7] We have uploaded our unlearning-
- [3/14] We have uploaded our first version of [Safety Mirage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11832) to the Arxiv platform. -->

## Install

Our safety-unlearn framework has been developed on the LLaVA-1.5, so the require installments could also be found from [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA).
Also, you could use following steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to LLaVA folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OPTML-Group/VLM-Safety-MU
cd VLM-Safety-MU
```

2. Install Package
```Shell
conda create -n llava python=3.10 -y
conda activate llava
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
```

3. Install additional packages for training cases
```
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Unlearning Fine-tune
Our base model LLava-1.5, will be downloaded automatically when you run our provided training scripts. No action is needed.

For full-parameter unlearning fine-tune, you should run
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 bash scripts/v1_5/finetune_unlearn.sh
```

For LoRA unlearning fine-tune, you should run
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 bash scripts/v1_5/finetune_unlearn_lora.sh
```

Some unlearn options to note:

- `--unlearn_type`: unlearning algorithm type, which could be 'npo' or 'rmu'.
- `--rmu_XXX`: are the specific hyperparameters for rmu algortihm.
- `--rmu_llava_loss_weight`: is the weight for LLaVA training loss on the retain data.
- `--rmu_retain_alpha`: is the weight for rmu loss on the retain data.
- `--npo_beta`: is the balancing parameter for npo algortihm.
- `--npo_forget_alpha`: is the weight for npo loss on the forget data.
- `--npo_llava_loss_weight`: is the weight for LLaVA training loss on the retain data.

Also, the data path and the output dictionary should also be specified~
